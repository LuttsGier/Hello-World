# Hello-World
This is my greeting to the Git World that I am active and learning the functions of this website. 
This is the beginning of my learning. There is a guide on the markdown Syntax which is located in this link [title](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). 
## Syntax examples
**The double stars around this text make all text within bold**
*One star each side turns the text italic*
> This is the method for quotation
>
> The quote for the day is "idleness brings want"

Some syntax is the same as standard word such as lists, i.e

1. First item
2. Second item
3. And third

Or 
- First
- Second
- Third
